# Gold-Price-Prediction
- Developed machine learning models to predict gold prices using a comprehensive dataset of historical financial metrics, implementing XGBoost, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression for robust forecasting.  
- Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing and handling, ensuring efficient dataset preparation across both projects.  
- Applied StandardScaler for feature normalization to enhance model performance and consistency in predictions.  
- Visualized data and results using Matplotlib and Seaborn, providing clear insights into trends and model outputs.  
- Created and evaluated predictive models by generating comparison DataFrames, assessing the accuracy of adjusted close price forecasts for each approach.
